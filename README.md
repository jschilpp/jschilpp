### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD Student in Information Systems at the University of Mannheim, Germany, interested in diverse topics surrounding data and analytics.

More information is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-schilpp-332490127/ "Jan Schilpp | LinkedIn") and on the [University of Mannheim Website](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/hoehle/team/academic-staff/jan-schilpp/ "Jan Schilpp | Business School").

For a sample of my work, you can read this [Medium Blogpost](https://medium.com/@jan.schilpp/how-big-the-cheating-problem-in-counterstrike-2-actually-is-ad8fdc659d15 "Suspicious Player in Counter-Strike 2") where I analyze granular video game trace data to quantify the number of suspicious Counter-Strike 2 players that were removed in a ban wave. The replication material is available in [this repository](https://github.com/jschilpp/cs2-suspicious-players "jschilpp/cs2-suspicious-players")
